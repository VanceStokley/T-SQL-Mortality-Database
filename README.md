These are the scripts and querys to make a t-sql Database with the data downloaded from the vital records mortality I used to make the mortality age and suicide levels by age, sex, occupation, and years report

downloadable from here: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm#:~:text=use%20data%20files.-,Downloadable%20Data%20Files,for%20independent%20research%20and%20analyses.

download the zip and convert them to .dat or .txt (.dat is more reliable)

I used years (2018-2023) for other years you will have to figure out row length and configure the xml like wise.

2018-2019 is 490 bits in length see frmtMort_490.xml

2020-2023 is 817 bits in length see frmtMort_817.xml
